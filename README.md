# J124 Final: Data Analysis and Visualization of Ojai Drought Causing People to Move out of Town
# By Sasha Frazier
## Story Pitch:
While sunny Ojai, CA is most widely known as a tourist destination, is also a huge agricultural town with ranches, farms, orchards, and residential gardens. These grounds, and people’s abilities to tend to their own, are the driving forces drawing people into Ojai. Many locals live off the lands, raising livestock and crops, and depend on the weather and natural resources to maintain their livelihoods. According to Ventura River Ecosystem, 67% of Ojai’s annual water use is allocated for agriculture. Rain is a big factor for the ranchers in Ojai, and in recent years, its absence has been driving them out of town.

Ojai has been experiencing increased drought conditions the past couple years. In 2021, Ojai received its lowest amount of rainfall on record according to VC Watershed and the 5 driest years recorded have all been within the last 10 years according to NIDIS. As a result of this, water rates have been increasing, making it more difficult for ranchers to afford their utility bills. These increased utility bills, leading to the inability to grow crops and feed livestock, has forced ranchers to move out of Ojai and take their farming elsewhere. According to World Population Review, recent population projections reflect this phenomenon as population growth rates are set to decrease, starting with 2021.

   1. I would use this source to highlight that 2021 had the lowest rainfall in Ojai Record. This is significant because in 2021, the population growth rate decreased and is projected to maintain a negative rate from that point on.
